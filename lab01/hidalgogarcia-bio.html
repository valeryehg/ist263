        <p id="greeting" class="bio">Hi!</p>
            <p class="bio">I’m Valerye Hidalgo Garcia and I’m double majoring in Innovation, Society, and Technology and Women’s and Gender Studies.</p>
        <p class="bio">My interest lies in exploring how sociocultural structures intersect with data governance, surveillance, and privacy.</p>
        <p class="bio"> Particularly, I enjoy exploring how certain demographics may become “lost in the machine” and the politics of data justice</p>
        <p class="bio">Outside of my studies, I’m an avid reader, collage artist and multimedia writer.</p>
        <p class="bio">My work can be found in <a href=https://thefigureone.com/7a/garcia/>Figure 1 Digital Poetry Journal</a> and Perceptions Magazine here on campus. Sometimes you can find me watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer or the X-Files. </p>
