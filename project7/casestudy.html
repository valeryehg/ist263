            <p>
                To ground some of the content previously introduced, I want to look at a company that is widely recognized and used across the world, Facebook. This case study is meant to be a brief application on dominance of digital space in the Global South, and not a deep dive to keep the information concise and digestible. 
            </p>

            <p>
                A member of Facebook's board directors <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35542497" target="_blank">tweeted</a> “Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?” in 2014, after backlash regarding Facebook's attempts to introduce their Free Basics internet plan to India. Free Basics was intended to be an internet plan that allowed “the poorest people” to have access to the Internet, but it provided Facebook with greater benefits than the people who were supposed to be its users.

                Although the Free Basics internet plan was ruled illegal by India's telecom regulator, Facebook has continued its expansion in India through other routes.
            </p>
            <p> In <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2022/series-on-digital-colonialism-how-meta-aims-to-dominate-indias-agriculture-sector/" target="_blank">2020, Facebook bought a 9.9% stake in Reliance Jio</a>, India's largest telecom provider. Reliance Jio is owned by Reliance Industries (RI), which has a monopoly over various sectors such as the retail sector, with RI being named the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-king-of-india-retail/articleshow/89865322.cms?" target="_blank">"king of retail."</a> The core retail categories include grocery, consumer electronics, and apparel. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Facebook has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/india-approves-facebooks-5-7-billion-deal-with-reliance-jio-platforms/" target="_blank">argued</a> that investing in Reliance Jio is “pro-competitive, benefits consumers, Kirana stores (neighborhood stores) and other small and micro local Indian businesses, and takes forward the vision of digital India.” Others have <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2022/series-on-digital-colonialism-how-meta-aims-to-dominate-indias-agriculture-sector/" target="_blank">argued</a> that the deal could put strain on food security, as the Facebook-Reliance deal food shift the food supply structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                In India, Facebook has expanded beyond its role as a social media platform. Facebook's messenger, WhatsApp has a payment feature, WhatsApp Pay that has become a part of payment systems in India such as Reliance JioMart, an online grocery store. WhatsApp has also begun to offer business loans in collaboration with India Infoline Finance Limited, a non-banking financial company. Facebook is trying to break down the line between regular businesses and banks, deeming that <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/06/27/the-worlds-most-important-war-on-big-tech-comes-from-india/" target="_blank">selling loans and offering credit</a> as one of the “main objects to be pursued by the country.”
            </p>

            <p>
                India's food supply structure prior to Facebook's expanding economic grip consisted of the state buying most of the food from farmers with a minimum price guarantee to the farmers and allowed for poor individuals to purchase food through the public distribution system. A large section of the population depends on this system, which covers <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/blog/how-indias-food-based-safety-net-responding-covid-19-lockdown" target="_blank">800 million people</a>. With Facebook's intervention, farmers can sell to corporate buyers which would leave farmers with even lower wages; Reliance Industries would be the biggest buyer of farmers' product and the biggest beneficiary as Reliance controls <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/06/27/the-worlds-most-important-war-on-big-tech-comes-from-india/" target="_blank">40% of the grocery sector</a>. This presents Facebook with financial opportunities beyond ads, and beyond information harnessed from its social media platforms; this information would now include any sale or purchase made via WhatsApp Pay detailing things such as retail preferences, finances, and people's needs/interests. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Neighborhood stores and small merchants may become dependent on Reliance Jio and Facebook as they usurp multiple sectors of India’s supply chain, leaving them with no business or relying heavily on these corporations to maintain a business. Colonialism’s underlying function of empire building, exploitation of the workforce and appropriation are occurring within this context.  Colonialism “…declares control of the social, economic, and political sphere by reordering and reinventing social order in a manner that benefits it.” Facebook already has a large user base in India and has begun to erase the line between business and banking and has shifted the structure of their entire food supply chain.  Previously a social media company, Facebook has expanded its scope through its usurping of economic systems and social systems of countries in the Global South, making them dependent on their products and shifting policy. Much like colonial conquest, the impact this has on the peoples of India is not of concern in the same way that maximizing extraction and profit is.
