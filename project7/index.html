                    <h2>What is digital colonialism?</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        There are various dimensions to digital colonialism, and as a result there are many ways to define Digital Colonialism, however <a href="https://abebabirhane.com/" target="_blank">Abeba Birhane</a>, a cognitive scientist who works at the intersection of machine learning, algorithmic bias, and human behavior provides an overview of what distinguishes digital colonialism from “traditional colonialism” in the following quote:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote cite="https://script-ed.org/article/algorithmic-colonization-of-africa/">
                    "Traditional colonial power seeks unilateral power and domination over colonized people. It declares control of the social, economic, and political sphere by reordering and reinventing social order in a manner that benefits it. In the age of algorithms, this control and domination occurs not through brute physical force but rather through invisible and nuanced mechanisms such as control of digital ecosystems and infrastructure … While traditional colonialism is often spearheaded by political and government forces, digital colonialism is driven by corporate tech monopolies – both of which are in search of wealth accumulation” – Abeba Birhane, <a href="https://script-ed.org/article/algorithmic-colonization-of-africa/" target="_blank"><em>Algorithmic Colonization of Africa (2020)</em></a>.

                    <h2>Why does this matter?</h2><br>
                    <p>It affects <em>everyone</em>.
                        Challenging digital colonialism is not a rejection of technology, but rather a reckoning with particular modes of production and business models that are being reproduced and continuously expanded.</p><br> <p>We are all affected by the data that is collected from us: digital traces of our interactions with others, how much time we spend on certain apps, our browsing history, locations, etc. are leveraged by businesses, and institutions. Whether it be directly or indirectly, profitable outcomes are put above considerations of long-term social impacts and consequences.</p><br>
                        <p>The “private sphere” is no longer “private” and has become deeply enmeshed with the public sphere, due to the digitization and automation of everyday life. The data that is collected from you may affect your insurance premium or be factored into determining your creditworthiness such as when you're buying a house or trying to open a new card.</p>

                    <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2><br>
                    <p>Data and technology are not inherently objective, they bear the imprint of human creators. This imprint, much like a fingerprint, is a complex labyrinth of crossings and interconnections that are only truly visible when under close examination.</p><br><p>The imprint is always there, intertwined with the social and cultural contexts that are present during the production and widespread usage of data and technology. This intricacy leads to critical approaches often being overlooked by those who are involved in the production or use of data and technology, either due to the complexity of the material or the overwhelming volume of information that needs to be sifted through.</p><br><p>This website aims to provide an introductory exploration to “digital colonialism” through small examples, hoping to generate interest in the subject matter and encourage readers to explore other resources. </p>
