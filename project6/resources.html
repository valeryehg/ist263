    <h2>What Can be Done for Such a Deeply Entrenched Problem?</h2>
        <p>
            Change does not happen overnight, and changing the landscape of tech will be a slow process; the rapid development of technology outpaces the chance for critiques and concerns to be raised. The tech landscape likely won't change in my lifetime, but we can work towards building foundational principles and knowledge for others to expand upon and apply to their contexts. Singular people cannot change worldwide business and production politics, but we can start small and change the landscape in our personal lives and the lives of those around us. Imagining a new future, or changes to what we currently know is an exercise in creativity. Here are <a href="https://www.sdsntrends.org/blog/2021/datacolonialism?locale=en" target="_blank">some suggestions</a> that have been brought up by the Thematic Research Network on Data and Statistics (TReNDS):
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Ensuring that active management of new data sources and their methodologies are fully transparent to people within and outside of the organization. 
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Building on efforts to document current practices to establish clear guidance and governing standards.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Regulatory policies in the tech sector: “localization” of data, in which data about citizens are required to be stored within the country or “nationalizing” data in which data are turned into a resource that tech companies would have to pay for (at a level that would provide benefits to citizens)
                </li><br>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Other suggestions that may occur on a more community-based level:
            <ul>
                <li>Share articles on the topic that you found interesting to your peers and hold discussions about materials you've seen or read.</li><br>
                <li>Look at how you use data and technology, and how the people around you use it: think about the material impact that you may be generating.</li><br>
                <li>Discuss with peers how you can begin to implement small changes into your workflow or project development to critically review what you are working on.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>I'm interested in reading further about this topic, do you have any additional resources?</h3>
            <p>
                The cool thing about topics as encompassing as this, is that you can explore the application of digital colonialism in any sector that interests you! Here are some recommended articles and resources that may help you branch out or provide a deeper engagement:
